### Introduction
I wrote a program that can perform face detection and human skeleton extraction at the same time. The face detection is based on the Dlib library and OpenCV library. The human skeleton is extracted using OpenPose open source framework.
<br>In addition, it also includes the training of detection models, the production of skeleton templates, and the identification of abnormal movements based on the skeleton sequences.

In addition to the passenger detection with tracking and skeleton extraction code, it also includes the associated code such as escalator passenger face classifier training, passenger detection and tracking, skeleton extraction, 
skeleton template making and abnormal behavior detection and recognition based on skeleton sequences.
